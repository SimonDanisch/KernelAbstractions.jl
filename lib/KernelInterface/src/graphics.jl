# The graphics stage intrinsics a shader body calls.
#
# Beside `device.jl` and `raytracing.jl`, for the reason those two are here:
# a device-side name that a COMPILER lowers belongs under everything that
# compiles or runs a shader.
#
# These were declared in Mantle and defined AGAIN in Lava, with a bridge in
# `MantleVulkanExt` — `Mantle.$f() = Lava.$f()` — that existed only because Lava
# cannot override a Mantle name: Mantle depends on Lava, not the other way
# round. Both depend on KernelInterface. So each backend overrides here, no
# bridge is needed, and a downstream package imports one name from one place.
#
# What is NOT here, and deliberately:
#
#   * `set_position!`, `gfx_output`/`gfx_input` and their flat variants,
#     `geom_input`, `geom_input_position` — the older location-based way of
#     moving values between stages. A pipeline declares `varyings = (albedo =
#     Vec4f, …)`, a vertex stage returns `(position = …, albedo = …)` and a
#     fragment stage receives them by name. That is one declaration instead of
#     matched pairs of numbered slots, it works on both backends today, and
#     `bench/showcase.jl` is written in it. Seven names removed rather than
#     moved.
#   * A geometry stage's `emit_vertex!`/`end_primitive!` as the vocabulary a
#     shader body writes. They are still declared below, but as the LEAF a
#     native geometry lowering reaches, not as something an author calls: a body
#     emits through `emit!(gs, vertex)`, and the emitter it was handed decides
#     whether that becomes these or the mesh stage's indexed writes. See
#     `mesh.jl`, which explains why an argument-free pair cannot be lowered two
#     ways and why the mesh pipeline is the more general of the two.
#
# Indices are ONE-BASED on every backend. A shader that has to remember which
# convention a builtin follows will eventually get it wrong.

Declared as a leading parameter:

        …
    end

`vertex_index()` above is the same number and is what a body uses when it runs as
a real vertex stage: the rasteriser supplies it and there is nothing to pass. This
marker exists because a mesh stage HAS no such builtin, and a geometry stage
lowered onto one (see Mantle's `lower_geometry_to_mesh`) has to evaluate the
vertex body once per input vertex of its primitive — several times, in one
invocation, at indices it computes. A zero-argument builtin cannot answer
differently on each of those calls; a parameter can.

For an INDEXED draw the value is what the index buffer holds, matching
`vertex_index()`'s meaning on a real vertex stage rather than the position in the
draw. So the same body reads the same vertex either way.

Opt in per shader. A body that does not declare it keeps using `vertex_index()`
and nothing about it changes; a backend passes this only to bodies that ask, so
the two spellings coexist and neither is privileged.

an error, for three reasons: it takes an argument, it is meaningful on the host,
and a backend that agrees with the portable convention should not have to say
so.

A shader that does the viewport transform BY HAND — a shadow lookup turning
`sunvp * world` into a texel row — has to apply the same mirror, which is what
this is exported for. It is its own inverse.

Getting the vertex stage's half right and this half wrong is not a visible
mistake: a mirrored scene still looks like a scene, its shadow map is mirrored
with it, and two renders from the same backend agree perfectly. What gave it
