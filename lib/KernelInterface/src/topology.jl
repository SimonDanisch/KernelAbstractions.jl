Primitive topology: how a vertex stream is grouped into primitives.

Here for the same reason [`MatrixShape`](@ref) and [`DeviceCaps`](@ref) are.
Two sides need this vocabulary and neither can own it:

  * a **compiler** dispatches on it to emit the geometry stage's input
    execution mode — `TriangleList` → three vertices per invocation,
    `LineListAdjacency` → four;
  * a **backend** dispatches on it to create a pipeline —
    `VK_PRIMITIVE_TOPOLOGY_TRIANGLE_LIST`, `MTLPrimitiveTypeTriangle`.

It lived in Lava, which is a Julia→SPIR-V compiler, and a Metal backend needs
`TriangleList` without importing one. Defining it twice was the alternative, and
that is exactly what `DeviceCaps` did before it moved here — two declarations
bridged by a positional copy, which drifted.

Nothing here is any one API's. The names are the ones every graphics API uses.

    primitivevertices(t::Topology) -> Int

How many vertices one primitive of `t` has.

The number a geometry stage is handed per invocation, and the number a mesh
lowering writes per primitive. It is a property of the TOPOLOGY and nothing
else, which is why it is here: it was written out twice — once in Lava's SPIR-V
emitter to pick the geometry stage's input execution mode, once in Mantle's
Vulkan backend to size the arrayed inputs its geometry wrapper reads — and two
tables of one fact drift the moment a topology is added to one of them.

A strip's answer is the size of its sliding WINDOW, not the length of the strip:
a `TriangleStrip` delivers three vertices per primitive like a `TriangleList`,
and the two differ in how the index stream is walked, not in what a primitive
is.

    primitivestride(t::Topology) -> Int

How far the input assembler advances between one primitive and the next, in

This is the whole difference between a LIST and a STRIP, and it is not
[`primitivevertices`](@ref): both `LineListAdjacency` and `LineStripAdjacency`
hand a geometry stage four vertices, and they differ only here — the list
consumes a disjoint group of four, the strip slides a four-wide window one index
at a time. An adjacency list built for a strip read as a list yields `n / 4`
primitives instead of `n - 3`, which draws a polyline as scattered dashes.

A list's stride is its arity; a strip's is one.

    primitivecount(t::Topology, nvertices) -> Int

How many primitives a stream of `nvertices` assembles under `t`.

`(nvertices - (verts - stride)) / stride`: a list divides by its arity, a strip
subtracts the window it has to fill before the first primitive and then advances
one at a time. Both fall out of [`primitivevertices`](@ref) and
[`primitivestride`](@ref) rather than being a third table to keep in step.

**Fewer vertices than one primitive needs is a draw of NOTHING, not an error.** A
`lines` plot of a single point assembles no segment, and a pipeline asked for it
must submit zero work rather than throw at the caller: the count is clamped at
zero.

The index of `primitive`'s first vertex in the input stream.

what makes it one line: primitive `p` starts at `(p - 1) * stride + 1`. Both
indices are ONE-based, as the vertex stream is everywhere else here.

Returns the index in the type it was given, so a mesh stage handed an `Int32`
primitive id does no 64-bit arithmetic to find its vertices.
