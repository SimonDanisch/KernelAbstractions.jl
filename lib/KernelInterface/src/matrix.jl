# Cooperative matrix vocabulary
#
# The names a backend needs to describe what its matrix hardware can do:
# SPIR-V's `OpTypeCooperativeMatrixKHR`, CUDA's `wmma`, AMD's WMMA and Metal's
# `simdgroup_matrix` all expose the same three facts — which operand position a
# matrix occupies, whose registers hold it, and which `(M, N, K)` extents the
# device actually implements for a given type pair.
#
# **It is a vocabulary, not yet an interface.** There are deliberately no
# operations here — no load, no store, no multiply-accumulate. Those need a
# representation (SPIR-V hands back an opaque handle, CUDA a register tuple,
# Metal a builtin) and a dispatch story, and neither can be settled honestly
# against a single backend. The line is: settled semantics go in, open design
# decisions stay out. Everything here is either three singleton types whose
# meaning the hardware fixes, or a record of what a driver reported.

"""
    MatrixUse

Which operand position a matrix occupies in `A*B + C`: [`MatrixA`](@ref),
[`MatrixB`](@ref) or [`Accumulator`](@ref).

Part of a matrix's type rather than a property of the value, because the
hardware distributes the three differently across a subgroup's lanes: `A` by row,
`B` by column, the accumulator differently again. It is not an annotation any one
API chose — SPIR-V, CUDA (`wmma::matrix_a`) and AMD's WMMA all expose it, because
all three must. Metal's `simdgroup_matrix` is the exception, having one uniform
type.

The names are inherited and imperfect: they label a position in `C = A*B + C`
rather than the property they stand for, which is really which axis carries the
contraction. A matrix that is `B` in one product and `A` in the next needs a
conversion despite holding the same values.

    MatrixScope

Whose registers hold a matrix: one subgroup's ([`SubgroupScope`](@ref)) or the
whole workgroup's ([`WorkgroupScope`](@ref)).

Subgroup scope is the portable one. Workgroup scope exists on far less hardware
and buys register pressure — the same accumulator costs a fraction of the
components per lane when it is spread over every invocation instead of one
subgroup — so a kernel wanting it has to be selected against a device query
rather than reaching for it by default.

"""
    MatrixShape(ab, acc, M, N, K, scope)

One `(M, N, K)` matrix-multiply shape the hardware implements, for operands of
type `ab` accumulating into `acc`.

**Deliberately not parameterised on `ab`/`acc`.** A device reports a whole table
of these and the entries disagree on type — one card lists `16x16x16` for
`Float16 -> Float32`, `Float16 -> Float16`, `UInt8 -> Int32` and `Int8 -> Int32`.
As type parameters those are four distinct types, so the table's element type
becomes abstract and every entry boxes. Nothing is bought by it either: the shape
never reaches the device. It is queried once, cached by the backend, and the only
part that crosses into a kernel is an `Int` extracted from it and passed as a
`Val`.

`ab` and `acc` are separate because the pair is what distinguishes shapes in
practice; extents alone do not. Matching on `(M, N, K)` and ignoring the types
says "yes" for `Float16` on hardware that implements only the integer forms at
those extents, and the kernel then emits instructions the device cannot run.

Whether `s` is in the table — one passed directly, or the one a
[`DeviceCaps`](@ref) or a backend reports through [`matrix_shapes`](@ref).

(The `DeviceCaps` methods are in `caps.jl`, which defines the type; a signature
is evaluated where it is written.)

The bare-table form exists because a caller often holds the shapes already, and
forwarding to it keeps the search in one place instead of several `any(==(s), …)`
loops that drift apart.

A shape being present means the device declares it **legal**, which is not the
same as fast and not the same as implemented in silicon — a software rasterizer
reports cooperative-matrix shapes it emulates. Ranking legal shapes is the
caller's job.

The shape to use for `ab -> acc` at `scope`, or `nothing` if the device has none.

`nothing` rather than a default: a fabricated tile is a divisor, and a wrong one
divides silently. Every caller has to decide what to do without matrix hardware,
so it is better that the type system make them.

Preference is the squarest shape, then the largest. Square first because a
kernel tiling a square accumulator with a non-square instruction has to carry two
different blocking factors; largest second because a bigger tile is fewer
instructions for the same work. Both are tie-breaks among shapes the device
already declared legal — this chooses a *default*, and a kernel that has measured
something better on its own shapes should carry that in its plan instead.
